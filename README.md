### Hi there, I'm JayðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend focused web developer with an eye for frontend design. Currently my portfolio reflects skills in React and frontend development, though I'm working to put out more projects that focus on my backend interests. I'm particularly interested in cyber security and hope to expand my skillsets in that field.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building out my portfolio and showcasing more backend projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about the hosting process and creating appropriate development and production environments, as I'd found difficulties in those areas while completing my final project in college.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything! If you'd like to work on a project just let me know and we'll see if it's doable.

- ðŸ“« Add me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jjkneiss/) to reach out or leave a message on the discussions board in this repo!
