### Hi there, I'm JayðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend focused web developer with an eye for frontend design. Currently my portfolio reflects skills in React and frontend development, though I'm working to put out more projects that focus on my backend interests. I'm particularly interested in cyber security and hope to expand my skillsets to include protection against various attacks.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything! If you'd like to work on a project just let me know and we'll see if it's doable.
