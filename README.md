### Hi there, I'm JayðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a tenacious, results oriented Frontend Web Developer with a penchant for optimization where possible. I'm always trying to learn something new, whether thatâ€™s behind a monitor, in the garage woodworking, in front of a client, or at home learning to cook a new meal. Iâ€™m an open book and Iâ€™m always willing to talk where time permits, feel free to reach out. I'd like to build my backend skills out further and eventually make my way into a Cyber Security oriented role.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building out my portfolio and showcasing a varied skillset.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about the hosting process and creating appropriate development and production environments.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always willing to collaborate on something! If you'd like to work on a project just let me know and we'll get it done!

- ðŸ“« Add me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jjkneiss/) to reach out or leave a message on the discussions board in this repo!
